# Snapper

I wanted to use snapshot tests in a zig project. I read [this article](https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2024-05-14-snapshot-testing-for-the-masses) from the Tigerbeetle blog and decided to try out the code they have written.

This is packaged for me to use in different projects without needing to maintain copied of the file if I decide to make changes.
